### 👋🏼 Hi there, I'm Nan 

I build products and lead teams — **I'm working on something new!** 

_Previously I've been..._
- VP of Product at [Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/)
- CTO at [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/)
- Eng. leader at [Abstract](https://www.abstract.com/)
- Developer at [GS](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) & [Merrill](https://www.ml.com/)

I also contribute to [Outline](https://github.com/outline). You can contract me @**thenanyu** on most platforms, including gmail.
